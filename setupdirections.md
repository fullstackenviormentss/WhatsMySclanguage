# Directions
## Get a Scala project up and running
I haven't used Scala in a while so I'm going to keep tabs on how I get things going here

### New Project
1. `sbt new sbt/scala-seed.g8`
- Opens a shell and asks for a project name
- Creates a `<name>` folder and puts `src`, `project`, and `build.sbt` in it
- `target` is created in the current folder
- I moved everything in `<name>` into the current dir, don't want too much depth...
